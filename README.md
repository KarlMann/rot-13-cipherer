The program itself is compiled on a Fedora Workstation 24 OS and should work

then you have to compile the source code(rot-13.cpp) to work in your platform
before you can use it.

# Usage:
The program is a CLI program.
TO use it you have to type in your shell:
  ./rot-13.exe 
Upon start the program will prompt for the directory and/or filename of
the file that you want to cipher, then the name of output-file where
you want to write the ciphered version of the o, riginal file.
The program should work on any file that you can open using a text-editor
